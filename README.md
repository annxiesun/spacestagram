## Extra Features
**Branding**
- I love creating branding for all my projects so I created a small logo that parodies instagram for this project
- I also created a graphic to display if the user hasn't like any photos

**Unique UI**
- Because of the long descriptions for each photo, I created a UI that shows preview for each photo to be first and then the user can choose to see full descriptions of photos they are intrigued by 

**Save Likes after Reload**
- I used local storage to keep track of the photos the user liked and I used a hash-map to store these values to optimize the system

**Liked Photos**
- What's the point of liking the photo if it does nothing? That's why I added a new page that displays all the photos the user has liked

**Link to Share Photo**
- The user can also share the photo with friends by using the unique link generated for each photo

**Animations**
- I wanted to bring the app to life so I used animations to convey what's happening in the UI.
	- A 'pop' to the 'Like button' to bring it to life
	- A spinner to show that the app is loading
	- Components sliding up or down to convey their position
